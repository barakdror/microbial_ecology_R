#this code creates lovely heatmaps, with additional annotations if possible.
#first, read your matrix table (meaning the table with what you want to plot inside the heamtap)
#notice you need it to be matrix, so avoid unneccsary columns with strings:
matrix=read.csv("C:/Users/Barak/OneDrive/documents/דוקטורט/papers/Dror 2019_exp/metagenomes_sets_results_clones/heatmap_results.csv", row.names = 1)
#you can 'eliminate' a column by assigning NULL to it, and it won't be read by R:
matrix$subtype=NULL
#view your matrix to see it's ok:
View(matrix)
#now read your annotation file, where the first column MUST match the first column of the matrix (that's make sense right?)
annot=read.csv("C:/Users/Barak/OneDrive/documents/דוקטורט/papers/Dror 2019_exp/metagenomes_sets_results_clones/annotation.csv", row.names = 1)
View(annot)
#install pheatmap package, and them upload it:
library("pheatmap")
#now notice the command:
#color- the colors of the matrix (e.g. red/green for 1 and 0)
#cluster- whether to cluster by rows or coulmns, or not at all
#gaps- if you want to devide the heatmap to 'boxes' just give it the row/column number gaps
#file name- the name of your heatmap with the required format- png, jpeg, jpg. etc.
#annotation row- the annotation dataframe you uploaded above
#annotation colors- specific colors for the annotation. If you won't specficy this argument, it will assign colors automatically
